# Factorio-JD-Plays



A mod for streamer JD-Play's server. Includes a number of distinct modes.


General Notes
==============

All listed modes below "should" still just work, but only the top one was tested during most recent updates.
All modes from before Factorio 1.1 have been removed from the active mod as part of the upgrade to 1.1. The code is retained in a deactivated fashion, but would require updating and testing to re-enable.



JD Spider Race
================

A race by 2 teams to hunt down a massive hostile australian spider and kill it on a parallel frontier style map.

Easter Egg Suprise (2022)
================

When Biter Egg Nests are destroyed sometimes random items will be revealed as having been collected within the nest.
- Expected Mods: Biter Eggs
- When Biter Egg Nests are destroyed and the chance of neither it containing some number of biters or worms occurs, some random items will be revealed as being within the nest. Biter Eggs mod settings control the chance of an egg containing either biters or worms. But also contains settings that can then potentially spawn 0 of them in. This would lead to 0 items as the chance of biter/worms was met.
- These random items will be 1 item per small egg nest and 1-3 items per large egg nest.
- These items will just be simple vanilla items (with equal chance weight): iron plate, copper plate, steel plate, green circuits, gears, pipes, basic ammo, walls, gun turrets.
- There won't be a repeat item within the same destroyed egg nest.



JD P0ober Split Factory
==============

There is an impassable divide splitting the map in half; east and west. P0ober has the west side as her home, while JD has the east side.
- Both sides are on the same team, sharing research progress, etc.
- When a player dies they will always respawn on their home side of the divide.
- Underground belts can go under the divide, while power pole wires and robots can go over the divide.
- There is a teleport on each side that can transfer the player's conscience into a cloned body on the other side of the divide. The cloned body can only be controlled for 15 minutes before you're returned to a new body on your own side. When a conscience leaves a body for any reason the body dies.
- Spider vehicles will be blocked from walking over (or near) the divide.

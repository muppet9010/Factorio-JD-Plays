Spiders atomic bombs:
	Change to be a small blast area of 5 tiles radius. With the impact damage being very high to kill whatever it hits still, but the blast area being a simple area damages of enough to kill turrets. I'd expect a player in a spider to loose the spider, but not to die themselves if possible. So I think the damages want to be ordered from outer to inner. So that the direct hit happens last, meaning any ejected player from the direct hit doesn't then taken additional damage from the radius ones.


/Evolution commmand:
	React to a player using the non admin default game command and add a supplementary response with the team north and south enemy Evo levels. I can;t stop the base games resposne from what I can see. So the enemy evo returned will always be wrong :(

On player leaving doesn't update the player GUI.
Have Player GUI list the current number of online players in each team.
Have the player GUI highlight the player when selected as well as showing their name at the bottom the GUI.
Check the GUI updates for all player join and leave events, not just on first connection.
Put offline after offline players names in brackets.



Make sure all open GUIs are reloaded on joining.



So it crashes if an admin tries to assign a player to a team once they have left.
